		<tr> <td> French and British settlers first established their permanent colonies in Canada around 16-17th centuries.


<br> The Indigenous peoples, who were inhabiting Canada long time before that, had their own established culture, traditions, beliefs and distinct trade networks. Some of these civilizations had long faded by the time first Europeans arrived. They have later been discovered archeologically. 

<br> The first French settlers were helping the Hurons (a tribe that lived along the north shore of lake Ontario) fight against the Iroquois Confederacy. 

<br> The intercolonial wars were common between British and French in the 18th century. At the same time, a number of Indigenous tribes were trying to form alliances with the Europeans to get protection from other Indigenous tribes and in order to continue benefiting from fur trade. 

<br> The Treaty of Paris was signed in 1763 and Canada became British. 
The proclamation organized Great Britain's new North American empire and stabilized relations between the British Crown and Aboriginal peoples, formally recognizing aboriginal title, regulated trade, settlement, and land purchases on the western frontier. 

<br> In the former French territory, the new British rulers of Canada first abolished and then later reinstated most of the property, religious, political, and social culture of the French-speaking residents through the Quebec Act of 1774.

<br> On July 1, 1867 the Dominion of Canada was formed and the expansion West began. 
Sir John A Macdonald oversaw the creation of the RCMP and the construction of the transCanada railway. Canadian Criminal Code, public education and healthcare laws were in development. 

<br> In the meantime, the rebellion was started by the Indigenous people in Manitoba lead by Louis Riel. They were seeking independence. The rebellion was suppressed.

<br> As Canada was expanding, the Canadian government was now negotiating treaties with the local Indigenous peoples. 

<br> Reserves were created and the Indigenous populations largely moved there (sometimes forcibly) to make room for new settlers.

<br> In 1876 the Indian Act was introduced to govern the relations between the Indigenous peoples and the settlers. Under this act the government of Canada started the Residential School System, that only ended in 1996. 

<br> The Residential School System was run by churches and its main goal was to “integrate" and “civilize” the Indigenous peoples. The system caused significant suffering to the Indigenous families. 150,000 children  went through the system. Many were subjected to various forms of abuse.

<br> Disconnected from their families and culture and forced to speak English or French, students who attended the residential school system often ended up being unable to fit back into their communities. In mainstream Canadian society they experienced discrimination. 

<br> The legacy of the system has been linked to the increased prevalence of post-traumatic stress, alcoholism, substance abuse, and suicide. Some of these problems  persist within Indigenous communities today.

<br> On June 11, 2008 Stephen Harper publicly apologized for these practices on behalf of the Government of Canada. 

<br> In 2015, the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation was established and a multi-volume report detailing the testimonies of survivors and historical documents from the time was published. </td> <td>

Recently, we hear many calls for decolonization as it relates to Indigenous peoples in Canada.

According to the Merriam-Webster’s dictionary “decolonization” is “the process of making a colony or a group of colonies independent”.

This means that true decolonization should involve the following:

<br> 1. Transfer of power by the current Canadian government to the Indigenous peoples and opportunity to form the new government, free from colonizers’ influence.

<br> 2. A complete holt of all immigration to Canada until the new government is formed and the decision whether to renew immigration should be up to the new government.

<br> 3. Transfer of colonizer populations back to their ancestor countries, if the Indigenous government decided so. 


<br> There is also a lot of discussion around renaming streets, removing monuments of those who participated in the establishment and operations of the Residential Schools; who was not against slavery; who supported racist and discriminatory practices that are unacceptable today.

<br> 1.It is important to remember that human history has been very violent and wars, invasions, colonizations took place for thousands of years. Unfortunately, indigenous populations were displaced and oppressed in many parts of the world. Similar events took place in Canada.
<br> 2. Residential schools caused  tragedy and suffering to the Indigenous population. The Canadian Government’s fear of Indigenous rebellions and expansionist policies resulted in some terrible decisions. At the time, however, Sir John A MacDonald, first Canadian Prime Minister, was re-elected multiple times, most of the time with majority and was in power for 19 years. In fact, the last residential school was closed only in 1996. So all Canadian Prime Ministers up to that time did not shut down this cruel system.
For example, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, while increasing immigration and promoting freedom of identity and expression, did not put an end to the Residential School System. </td> <td>

Rather than focusing only on dismantling and erasing the past and calling it “decolonization", we could advocate  for the rights of the Indigenous peoples.

<br> It is important to realize meaningful changes that will help the communities of the Indigenous peoples thrive.

<br> One of the issues that needs to be addressed is access to clean water on the reserves.

<br> Another one is availability of the mental health support, as the number of suicides among Indigenous youth is 7 times higher than the rest of the population. 

<br> It is also important to provide economic opportunities, employment,  and promote entrepreneurship among the Indigenous youth.
