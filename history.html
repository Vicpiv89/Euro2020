		<br> <h2>The History of the UEFA European Championship</h2> <br>		
		<h4 class="underlineh4">1927-1980</h4> 
		<h6>The idea of a European football tournament was first proposed in 1927 by the French Football Federation's secretary general Henry Delaunay. The tournament did not start until 1958, 3 years after Delaunay had passed, but in his honor, the trophy awarded to the champions is named after him. <br> <br>
		The first tournament was in 1960, hosted in Paris, where 17 countries participated. The tournament was won by the Soviet Union, defeating Yugoslavia 2-1 in the final. <br> <br> 
		29 teams entered the second tournament in 1964, which was won by hosts Spain after they defeated the USSR 2-1 in the final. <br> <br> 
	    Italy hosted and won the 1968 tournament, after drawing to Yugoslavia 1-1 and defeating them 2-0 in the replay. <br> <br>
	    West Germany won the 1972 tournament hosted in Belgium, after winning 3-0 against the Soviet Union in the final. <br> <br>
	    Czechoslovakia won the 1976 tournament hosted in Yugoslavia, defeating West Germany 5-3 on the newly introduced penalties. <br> <br>
		</h6>
		<h4 class="underlineh4">1980-1996</h4> 
		<h6>The final competition was expanded to 8 teams in 1980, in which they would play in a group stage. The winners of the groups would play a final match for the trophy. <br> <br>
		West Germany won the 1980 tournament hosted in Italy, after defeating Belgium 2-1 in the final. <br> <br>
		France won their first major title hosted at home, when they defeated Spain 2-0 in the 1984 final. <br> <br>
		The Netherlands won the 1988 tournament hosted in West Germany, after defeating the Soviet Union 2-0 in the final.<br> <br>
		Denmark were only in the 1992 final tournament because of political issues with Yugoslavia. This did not stop them from winning the competition hosted in Sweden, when they defeated Germany 2-0 in the final.<br> <br>
		</h6>
		<h4 class="underlineh4">1996-2020</h4>
		<h6>In 1996, the final tournament was expanded to 16 teams. <br> <br> 
		Germany won the 1996 competition in England, after beating Czechia 2-1 in the final.<br> <br>
		France won the 2000 competition after defeating Italy 2-1 in the final. The competition was hosted in the Netherlands and Belgium.<br> <br>
		Greece won in 2004, beating hosts Portugal 1-0 in the final.<br> <br>
		Spain beat Germany 1-0 in the 2008 final hosted in Austria and Switzerland.<br> <br>
		Spain became the first nation to win two consecutive European cups, after defeating Italy 4-0 in the 2012 final hosted in Ukraine and Poland.<br> <br>
		The next tournament was expanded to 24 teams. This idea was first proposed in 2007, rejected by 3 nations, and finally accepted in 2016. The competition was won by Portugal after defeating hosts France 1-0 in the final.<br> <br>
		<h4 class="underlineh4">2021</h4>
		<h6>This is being written on July 8th, 2021. As of now, England and Italy have progressed to the final of the competition, which is to be played on the 13th on July, 2021 at the Wembley stadium in London, England.
